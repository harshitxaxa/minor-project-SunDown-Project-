# minor-Project-
This is my first front-end project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) along with CSS animations to add smooth transitions and interactive visual effects. The project showcases basic front-end development skills with a focus on clean layout, animation, and user experience.
